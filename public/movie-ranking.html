<h1>The Best Movies According to Miles</h1>
<h2>My top  3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>The Avengers series was my favorite growing up because I was always<br>
a huge marvel fan! This was the ending of the movie series.</p>
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>This movie was very well put together and a great branch off from the<br>
original Top Gun movie.</p>
<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>This movie was a rollercoaster of emotions. The way they portrayed his harsh<br>
environment of his journey to become a face in the jazz drummer world was insane.</p>
